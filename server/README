This directory contains the code to run the local server.
This server listens for connections from the Lambda function and relays those
commands to the Vera controller.

The server should be able to run on any machine (Windows/Linux/Mac) but not all
configurations are tested. Some of the non-core functionality is platform
specific (e.g. running as a service under Linux).
