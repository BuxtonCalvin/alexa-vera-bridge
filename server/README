This directory contains the code to run the local server.
This server listens for connections from the Lambda function and relays those
commands to the Vera controller.

The server should be able to run on any machine (Windows/Linux/Mac) but not all
configurations are tested. Some of the non-core functionality is platform
specific (e.g. running as a service under Linux).

Tested configurations
-----------------------
Mac OSX (10.11.2) running Python 2.7.10
Ubuntu 14.04 running Python 2.7.11 (check)
Windows 10 running Python 2.7.11 (check)
 * Running as service requires external application (e.g. AlwaysUp)
Raspbian Jesse running Python ?? (check)

File Descriptions
-------------------
server.cfg - Configuration file for server
server.py - Server implementation
test_client.py - Locally invokes client (lambda/client.py) to test server
install.sh - Shell script that installs the server as a service

TODO
 - make messaging more robust
   - fix msg protocol
   - multi-threaded server design (timeout dead connections)
   - more error checking
 - install server as service
 - logging feature
 - abstract out messaging protocol to Vera (or make it more extensible?)
