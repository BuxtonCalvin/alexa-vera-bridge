THINGS TO DO
--------------
1) get run_unit_tests script parsing correctly
2) test remote using aws invoke
3) test_client.py command line options
4) finish quick start documentation
5) be better with device names. for example, i should be able to say "Alexa, ask
  vera to turn on the bedroom light" instead of "Alexa, ask vera to to turn on device 1"
  This requires parsing the device information we get back from Vera via the /status
  endpoint and also extending the ASK voice model to parse out the names.

On client
-----------

QUESTIONS
 - What are session_attributes?
 - What are the various flows a skill gets invoked with?
 - do i import everything with __future__?
