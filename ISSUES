ISSUES
1) with plain ssl security (no cert checking) we get a no shared cipher error
2) in client.cfg we assume everything is in the same director (since that's the way we upload to Lambda) but the test cases want to look for security assets elsewhere. How to fix?

THINGS TO DO
get run_unit_tests script parsing correctly
test local lambda execution
test remote using aws invoke
