ISSUES
1) with plain ssl security (no cert checking) we get a no shared cipher error

THINGS TO DO
get run_unit_tests script parsing correctly
test remote using aws invoke

add test cases for test_client.py
fix some server robustness in the way it handles connections

security_test.py
 - psk is hardcoded to /sample directory
 - add capability for if file is missing to skip test
 - kill on error (for example failing to bind to socket)

lambda
 - have to change entry point in AWS console (can it be done in upload.sh with CLI tools?)
 
test_client
 - if it fails the keys/certs are left in the directory. should cleanup
 
 security
  - On Mac a .srl is generated when creating new user certs. should add to git ignore...
  - user .csr files not ignored
