ISSUES
1) with plain ssl security (no cert checking) we get a no shared cipher error

THINGS TO DO
get run_unit_tests script parsing correctly
test remote using aws invoke

test_client.py command line options
fix some server robustness in the way it handles connections
 
security_test.py
 - add capability for if file is missing to skip test
 - kill on error (for example failing to bind to socket)

finish quick start documentation
