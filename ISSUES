THINGS TO DO
--------------
* unit testing
  - series of inputs to lambda function and the expected behavior
  - script will start server in correct mode, upload correct client code and
    use aws invoke to test
  - test cases are text input (JSON) and text output (JSON)
  - on test case failure the cloudwatch logs are pulled

* finish quick start documentation
* be better with device names. for example, i should be able to say "Alexa, ask
  vera to turn on the bedroom light" instead of "Alexa, ask vera to to turn on device 1"
  This requires parsing the device information we get back from Vera via the /status
  endpoint and also extending the ASK voice model to parse out the names. 
* getting PyCrypto to lambda
