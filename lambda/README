This directory contains all the files needed for the AWS Lambda function to
respond to events from the Alexa Skill we defined. Because we rely on
multiple files we can't simply use the inline editor in the Lambda web 
interface. Instead, we package all our files as a single zip file and upload
this to Lambda.

-------------------------
Installing Dependencies
-------------------------

AWS CLI tools
---------------
See the documentation at http://aws.amazon.com/cli/
Other links:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/index.html
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/setup.html

Basic steps:
 - pip install awscli
 - setup IAM user with permissions for all Lambda functions
 - configure awscli with userID/secret (run 'aws configure')

Security Assets
-----------------
You need to point the upload script to the path where the keys/certs you use
are stored.

Python modules
----------------
Current we don't use any. If you do, you need to upload the module along with
your code. See the AWS Lambda documentation for more info:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html

---------------------
Uploading to Lambda
---------------------
To create the zip file to upload, simply run the upload.sh script. If the AWS
CLI tools are installed this script also uploads the bundle to Lambda.
